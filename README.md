<h1 align="center">Boundary First Flattening (BFF)</h1>

BFF is an optimized and easy to use desktop application for surface parameterization. Unlike other [tools](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/editors/uv_image/uv/overview.html) for [uv mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_mapping), BFF allows real-time editing of high resolution maps with direct control over the shape of the flattened domain.

# Features

<img src=imgs/teaser.png height="475" width="475" align="right">

1. Automatic parameterization with minimal area distortion. This map is generated by default when the application is launched.

2. Direct manipulation of boundary lengths or angles of the flattened domain with a spline based curve editor.

3. Exact preservation of sharp corners for flattened domains like rectangles.

4. Seamless cone parameterization. This is a powerful technique for mitigating area distortion that first maps to a cone surface, which is flat everywhere except at a collection of isolated points. After cutting through these points, the cone surface is flattened into the plane without further distortion. Users can pick cones manually or use a built in algorithm to pick them automatically. Cutting is automatic.

5. Mapping to a unit disk for surfaces with boundary.

6. Mapping to a unit sphere for sphere like surfaces.

>    [Windows](https://www.google.com)

# Dependencies

1. [SuiteSparse](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html) (instructions to build SuiteSparse on Windows can be found [here](https://github.com/jlblancoc/suitesparse-metis-for-windows))
2. OpenGL (version 4.1 or higher)
3. [OpenGL Mathematics (GLM)](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html) (included)

# Compiling

On Mac OSX and Linux, compiling should be as simple as

```
git clone https://github.com/rohan-sawhney/boundary-first-flattening.git
cd boundary-first-flattening && git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
make -j 4
./bff
```

On Windows, create a Visual Studio project with Cmake after running the first three instructions above.
